title: 'Red Room'
age_range: 'Young toddlers'
description: 'In the Red Room, young toddlers have the opportunity to create their own knowledge through daily exploration, connections and interactions. We explore the environment through open-ended, play-based activities based on the childrenâ€™s interests and play that is observed. Children form attachments to peers and teachers as they develop social, cognitive, motor and language skills.'
