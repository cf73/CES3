description: 'The Yellow Room is for older 2-year-olds and young threes. In this room, we create a close classroom community, welcoming children from the toddler classes and children new to the school. We use the Inquiry Approach to develop year-long studies based on the childrenâ€™s interests as they explore the world around them through play and first-hand experiences. Past year-long Inquiries have been in Music, Pets, Construction, Food Preparation, and Simple Machines, to name just a few!'
