title: Special
testimonial: '<p>In our conversations with other parents, we always come back to the same refrain: Cambridge-Ellis is a special place. The kindness and gentleness of the teachers, the depth and creativity of the curriculum, the exuberance of the children’s art displayed everywhere, the sunlight that fills and warms the building – these are just some of the things that make Cambridge-Ellis a very special place. We couldn’t have asked for a better first school experience for our child.</p>'
