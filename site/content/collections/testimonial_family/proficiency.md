title: Proficiency
testimonial: '<p>We enrolled our daughter in the CES French immersion afterschool as a two-year-old despite not speaking any French at home. When she aged out of the classroom after four years, she entered an after school program catering to children from native French speaking families. Her new teachers were flabbergasted to learn that neither of her parents speak French! The ten hours a week spent with CESâ€™s wonderful teachers brought her to a level of proficiency on par with children who speak French at home every day with their parents. To keep up, her mom has even begun taking French lessons at night!</p>'
