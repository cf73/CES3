title: Creativity
testimonial: '<p>Thank you to the school and teachers for the two years of French instruction mixed with creativity and nurturing for the kids. It clearly paid off and our daughter has had the unique experience of exposure to a different culture and language which has expanded her world. During a recent trip to Paris&nbsp;I was astounded by how much more French she knew than we realized. Getting into a milieu where it was everywhere really brought it out and she was happy to use it wherever we went. It was so great and her accent is so spot on!</p>'
