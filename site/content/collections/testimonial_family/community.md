testimonial: '<p>CES is not only a place dedicated&nbsp;to the well being of each child, but it has an enduring sense of&nbsp;community. Our two children have thoroughly enjoyed the preschool and French immersion programs, as well as the summer camp. As our daughter Helen finished the purple room, we did not know who was going to miss CES more—our daughter or us—but we were sure that she was well prepared for her next school. Thankfully for us, our son Dylan started the following year in the Orange Room.</p>'
