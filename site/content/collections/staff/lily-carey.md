description: 'I am very excited to be joining the Red Room team at Cambridge-Ellis!  I was born and raised in Cambridge just a block away from the Cambridge-Ellis School. Since I was a preschooler myself, I have always been drawn to the visual arts. I worked at a Reggio Emilia-inspired preschool in Boston for 6 years, and I am so excited to be able to share my experience and to learn so much more from the children and staff at Cambridge-Ellis.'
