description: 'My history of work with Buildings and Grounds began in 1993, where I started working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Dormitory Housing Mechanic. Today, I am responsible for the upkeep and preventive maintenance of several Graduate and Undergraduate dormitories. In 2011, I started working at Cambridge-Ellis School as the evening Building Caretaker. I really enjoy interacting with the entire CES community, and find the environment to be a very happy, healthy, and productive workplace. On the weekends, I like spending time with my three teenage sons, being active outdoors, and listening to music.'
