description: 'I grew up in Lima, Peru and am fluent in Spanish and Portuguese. I completed my BA in Information Technology in Peru. Since moving to the US over a decade ago, I have had the pleasure of working with infants and children of all ages as a nanny. Through these experiences, I realized I wanted to become a teacher. In 2019, I completed my Associate’s Degree in Early Childhood and began working on my Bachelor’s at Cambridge College. I am eager to be working as a teacher in the Spanish class in our language program, and I am excited to continue in the Yellow Room as well on Wednesday’s. I love to travel with my family, and my favorite food is ceviche.'
