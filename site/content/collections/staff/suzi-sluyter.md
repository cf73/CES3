description: 'I began my Early Childhood career in 1983 as a teacher of preschool children with special needs.  I have taught in a number of diverse, urban settings ranging from preschool to third grade, in both public and independent schools.  It has been a great joy to work with and mentor many assistant teachers, student interns, and colleagues both as a Responsive Classroom trainer and as a classroom teacher over the years; and I am excited to continue supporting and learning with the talented faculty here at CES.  My passions revolve around working collaboratively to help children develop a love of exploration, creativity, and learning within a safe, fun, supportive, and loving classroom environment. I am excited to be a part of this vibrant community of engaged learners!'
