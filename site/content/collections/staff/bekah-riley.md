description: 'I am over the moon to join the Indigo Room this year! After graduating from Dartmouth College with a degree in Studio Art and Education, I joined Teach for America. I spent two years teaching bi-lingual preschool in Delaware, where I gained a passion for student-led learning through discovery and play. I am a native of upstate New York and spent several years teaching and directing at a small, nature-based, cooperative preschool there. Outside the classroom, I can be found painting, cooking, and cuddling with my cats.'
