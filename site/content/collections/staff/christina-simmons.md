role: 'Head Teacher'
description: 'During my senior year at Wheelock College, I was placed as a student teacher at Cambridge-Ellis. After graduating, I joined as a full-time teacher. During my second year in the Yellow Room, I completed my master’s degree at Wheelock. My master’s degree has a focus in English language learning, which has helped in the classroom. I enjoy working with preschool age children because it is so interesting to see the inquiry approach in action and how everything connects together.'
