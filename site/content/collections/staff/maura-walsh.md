role: 'Head Teacher'
description: 'After working as a head preschool teacher and student teacher supervisor at Boston University, I joined Cambridge-Ellis as a head teacher in 2009. I particularly enjoy working with the young preschoolers, for whom every new experience is enthralling and expands their view of the world. I am trained in the Inquiry Approach to curriculum development and implement it each year, exploring a topic of the childrenâ€™s interest in a year-long, in-depth study.'
