description: 'In 1983 after attending Lesley College for undergraduate and graduate school, I began teaching at Cambridge-Ellis. I also took some time during those years to open my own preschool program within a gymnastic center before returning to CES. Cambridge-Ellis is a magical place, where the possibilities for children, parents, and teachers to grow are endless. I am proud to be a part of this community and its mission to provide joyful, nurturing and rich learning experiences for young children.'
