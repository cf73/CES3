description: 'Cambridge Ellis has been my home since 1995. I am so proud to be a member of a collaborative professional learning community that supports and encourages educators to engage in the dynamic process of learning. I believe in guiding and supporting the development of resilience, trust, empathy, creativity, and confidence in the youngest learners at CES. This philosophy caries over to my family life as my husband and I enjoy spending time supporting and creating experiences to help our own children and family grow. I also take great pleasure in running, reading, and time with family and friends.'
