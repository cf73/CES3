title: 'Mary Anne Santos'
role: 'Co-Head Teacher'
description: 'I’ve been working with young children for most of my life: from babysitting, to working at a daycare in college, to finally earning my Master’s in Art Education. My passion finally led me here to CES. Teaching here allows me to really get creative with the children and staff, and create a rich, engaging classroom environment each day. It’s exciting to watch the kids make discoveries and guide them through the learning process on a day-to-day basis. Outside of school, I love to travel, read, and create my art.'
