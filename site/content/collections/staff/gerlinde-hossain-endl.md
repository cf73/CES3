description: 'My career in early childhood began in Austria, where I grew up. After moving to Boston I continued my education and taught preschool. I have been the director of early education programs in Cambridge for over two decades. I have come to understand the essence of success at Cambridge-Ellis School as a perfect balance between its warm and enriching environment, engaged teaching staff, and educational philosophy. It is an exciting and stimulating community of life long learners, and I am proud to be a part of it.'
education:
  - 'Bundes Bildungsanstalt für Kindergärtnerinnen'
