title: 'Hafsa Abdelmoula'
role: 'Head Teacher'
description: 'My love for languages, foreign literature, and history led me to study English and French linguistics, and focus on learning about different learning/teaching methods and theories. I lived, worked, and studied in both Algeria and France, and my career in education has consisted of teaching both English and French at various levels. After moving to the United States, I became a French certified teacher by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and then a preschool certified teacher by the Department of Early Education and Care. My dream and goal is to continue to share my knowledge and experience by teaching French in the United States, and I am very proud of being a member of the Cambridge-Ellis family. In my spare time, I love to read various types of literature and books regarding American history, and French and English Literature.'
