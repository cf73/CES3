role: 'Head Teacher'
description: 'I am absolutely thrilled to be part of the Green Room Team! I have wanted to work with children since I was a child myself, and pursuing teaching was a natural and almost automatic decision for me. It is always so fulfilling to help a child make a discovery or connection for the first time and watch them light up with excitement! After working in preschools in New York City for five years, I happily joined the Cambridge-Ellis community in September 2017. In my free time, I like to play string instruments and travel the world!'
