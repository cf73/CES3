description: 'I am proud to be a long-standing member of the Cambridge-Ellis School. Since 2000, I have supported many children from two to four years of age in the day program. In the afternoon, I continue helping children learn and grow as a member of the English after-school team. As a native speaker of Portuguese, I love to share my language and Brazilian culture with all the children at Cambridge-Ellis. Outside of school I enjoy family, cooking, dancing, and spending time with my cat Shana.'
