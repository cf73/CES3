    text: '<h1>Ways to Give</h1><p>One of the things that makes the Cambridge-Ellis School experience so special is the myriad ways families can invest in the school. Depending on what feels right to your family, you can contribute to the CES community by volunteering on a board or school committee, working with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge-ellis.org/pta-volunteerism/"><b>Parent Teacher Association</b></a>&nbsp;on fun events throughout the year, and contributing to the&nbsp;Cambridge-Ellis&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge-ellis.org/giving-events/"><b>Annual Fund</b></a>&nbsp;and annual spring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge-ellis.org/auction/"><b>Auction</b></a>&nbsp;event.&nbsp;</p><p>You may receive a request for additional, direct financial support on a few occasions: Youâ€™ll hear from the Development Committee during our Annual Fund drive in the fall (we are so proud that we have met our 100% participation goal for several years in a row, thanks to our incredible community!) and the Auction in the spring. The PTA leads collections for faculty and staff gifts during the holiday season and at the end of the school year.&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Every gift matters . . .&nbsp;</em></h3><p>In addition to becoming involved in the CES community, financial support in all amounts is welcomed. Financial gifts will&nbsp;support the financial aid needs of our community through tuition assistance for families, professional development opportunities for our faculty, as well as the many costs of running a school.&nbsp;Gifts to Cambridge-Ellis can be made in the following ways:</p><p><strong>Checks</strong><br>All gifts should be made payable&nbsp;to Cambridge-Ellis School.
