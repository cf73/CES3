    text: '<p>Cambridge-Ellis School has a history of helping families make an independent preschool education possible for their children. We are committed to providing scholarships to low and middle-income families to increase access to our programs. We currently dedicate approximately 8% of our tuition revenue towards scholarships, and aim to reach 10% by the end of our strategic financial plan year, 2020.</p><p>Fundamentally, financial aid enriches the experience of every member of the Cambridge-Ellis community by bringing together families from many backgrounds and experiences. We believe education and lifelong friendships forged at the school should be accessible to students of all economic backgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Scholarships are available for families who qualify for financial aid.
