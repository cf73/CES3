    text: '<p>Cambridge-Ellis School has a history of helping families make an independent preschool education possible for their children. We are committed to providing scholarships to low and middle-income families to increase access to our programs. We currently dedicate approximately 10% of our tuition revenue towards scholarships and aim to increase this percentage by the end of our strategic financial plan year in 2025.</p><p>Fundamentally, financial aid enriches the Cambridge-Ellis community by bringing together families from many backgrounds and experiences. We believe education and lifelong friendships forged at the school should be accessible to students of all economic backgrounds.</p><p><i>If you would like to be considered for scholarship funding, please visit&nbsp;</i><strong><a href="http://sssbynais.org/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>http://sssbynais.org/parents</i></a></strong><i>&nbsp;to apply.</i></p>'
