We are committed to providing scholarships to low and middle-income families to increase access to our programs. We currently dedicate approximately 10% of our tuition revenue towards scholarships and aim to increase this percentage by the end of our strategic financial plan year in 2025.</p><p>Fundamentally, financial aid enriches the Cambridge-Ellis community by bringing together families from many backgrounds and experiences. We believe education and lifelong friendships forged at the school should be accessible to students of all economic backgrounds.</p><p><em>If you would like to be considered for scholarship funding, you can apply <a href="http://sssbynais.org/parents"><b>here</b></a>.&nbsp;</em><em><br></em></p>'
