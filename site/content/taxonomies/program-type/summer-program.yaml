  Summer 2020
  Due to COVID-19 and per the order of Governor Baker, Cambridge-Ellis School will remain closed until June 29. We have made the decision to close our Summer Program for 2020. 
  
  Important Notes Regarding Registration:
  Limited spaces are available in all our programs. Once a program is full, you will have the option to add yourself to the waitlist. We will notify you if space becomes available.
  
  If you would like to add Extended Day (3:00-6:00 PM) care for one or more sessions, this may be selected in the “Participants & Options” section.
  
  Children must be 3 years old at the start of the program in order to enroll in any of the Language Immersion programs.
  
  A deposit is required to complete your registration. Your deposit amount is shown in the “Payment Plan(s)” section at checkout. The remainder of the balance must be paid by April 15. If you need to withdraw sessions or cancel completely, you may inform us by April 1 to be refunded.
