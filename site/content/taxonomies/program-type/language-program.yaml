  Our Language Program offers children a language immersion experience in French, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese, as well as English. In both our Day and Language Programs, all bilingual teachers bring elements of their culture and language into daily curriculum. Additional languages that are currently spoken include Hungarian and Portuguese. The teachers in each of the four classrooms infuse art, music, print, and materials from other cultures into the daily experience of each child. The program includes language instruction as an organic part of a relaxed, nurturing learning environment supported with developmentally-appropriate arts, crafts, music, cooking and outdoor play.
  
  All teachers are native speakers also fluent in English, and have experience in early childhood education. The program is designed for children whose primary language is English and is appropriately adjusted for children who are multilingual and native speakers.
  
  The Language Program at Cambridge-Ellis is open to children whether or not they attend the CES preschool program. The Rainbow Room is open to young toddlers. The French, Mandarin, and Spanish classes are open to children ages 2.9 to 6-years-old. There are between 9 and 19 children in each language classroom, so spaces are limited.
  
  The language classes meet 4 days a week, Tuesday through Friday, from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. Drop-off and pick-up times are flexible: Children can arrive between 3:00 and 3:30 and can be picked up between 5:30 and 6:00.
  
  On Monday afternoons we offer our Arts Avenue program. The program explores different music genres, learn about arts and artists, and immerse the children in arts activities and expression. See the Arts Avenue page in the Programs dropdown menu for more information.
