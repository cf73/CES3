  Our Language Program offers children a language immersion experience in French, Spanish, or Mandarin, as well as English in the Rainbow Room. The teachers in each of the four classrooms infuse art, music, outdoor exploration, print, and materials from other cultures into the daily experience of each child. The program includes language instruction as an organic part of a relaxed, nurturing learning environment supported with developmentally-appropriate arts, crafts, music, cooking, and outdoor play.
  
  All teachers are native speakers who are also fluent in English, and have experience in early childhood education. The program is designed for children whose primary language is English and is appropriately individualized for children who are multilingual and native speakers.
  
  The Language Program at Cambridge-Ellis is open to all children, whether or not they attend the CES Day Preschool Program. The Rainbow Room is open to young toddlers. The French, Mandarin, and Spanish classes are open to children ages 2.9 to 6-years-old. There are between 9 and 19 children in each language classroom, so spaces are limited.
  
  The language classes are 4 days a week, Tuesday through Friday, from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. On Mondays from 3:00-6:00 p.m., we offer our Monday Arts program. This program explores different music genres, and children learn about arts and artists, and they are immersed in art activities and many forms of artistic expression. You can learn more about this program on our Monday Arts page.
